for the first example the makefile needed the math lib included 

for the second example the following needed changed:
 char *replaceText(const char *s, const char *oldW, 
                                 const char *newW) { 
    char *result; 
    int i, cnt = 0; 
    // Error was here sizeof(newW) and sizeof(oldW) return the size of the pointer, not the length of the string
    int newWlen = strlen(newW); // strlen not sizeof !!
    int oldWlen = strlen(oldW);

Write a program that has one global variable then in the main function create a while or for loop
that increments that variable once a second.
Start that variable at 0 then increment it.
make sure to place a sleep so that it only tics once a second

Use the whereis function to print the address each time.

Next open two terminal windows and run the program at the same time so that we can
see the memory address increment.
